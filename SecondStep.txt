1. Subarray Related Problem
Solution: Segment Tree, Binary Index Tree, PreFix subarray.
Problems: Subarray Sum Range Sum Query(Binary Index Tree) Maximum Sub-matrix(From 2D to 1D)

2. Merge Two sorted List Problem
Solution: Heap, Merge Sort plus Merge Sort
Problems: Merge Sorted Array, Merge K Sorted Arrays
Plus: Interval Problem
Solution: to check the boundary of different interval and change the interval or add into
	  the array/List
Problem: Merge Two Sorted Interval Lists, Merge K Sorted Interval Lists

3. Median Problem: (Attention !!)
Solution: Remove, Binary Search(FindKth), FindKth(K - k / 2)
Problems: Median of Two Sorted Arrays, Median of K Sorted Arrays

August 4th:
Median Problem Review:
Solution 1:
FindKth (k - k / 2) : Boundary Case [3] [4] O(log(m + n))
FindKth (Binary Search) : Boundary Case count < k !!! O(log(Range)(log(m) + log(n))
Remove Method ï¼ˆUnsolved)
